## Decription
Lyric Library allows users to make an account to keep up with their favorite song information like lyrics and artist, as well as create playlists.

Technologies used: This is a MERN stack application that uses React and Material UI for the front end. Server side we’ve taken advantage of GraphQL, Node, and Express. To round it out and tie things together we’ve employed a MongoDB and mongoose database.
